<h1 class="page-title"> anti-harassment <br> policy</h1>

<div class="page-content">
    <div id="policy">
        The following anti-harassment policy covers all Tech@NYU events and
        activities and applies to all members, presenters, and other participants. <br><br>
        Furthermore, Tech@NYU will only lend its brand to or fund groups that
        offer a similar anti-harassment policy. For information on how to offer an
        anti-harassment policy to your group, see  <a class="email-us" style="font-size: 2vmin">Code for America's guide<a>, the
        advice of which can be generalized to non–Code for America groups. <br><br>
        Tech@NYU does not tolerate harassment in any form. We
        welcome everyone regardless of sex, race, gender, gender identity and
        expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, physical
        appearance, religion/faith, national origin, source of income, and language
        preference. <br><br>
        Harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive verbal or
        written comments related to, or exclusion based on, any of the characteristics
        listed above (i.e. sex, race, gender, etc.); deliberate intimidation;
        following or stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained
        disruption of talks or other events;
        inappropriate physical contact; unwelcome sexual attention; and
        patronizing language or action. <br><br>
        Further, sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any
        Tech@NYU event or activity, including talks.
        Anyone in violation of this policy may be warned, expelled from the
        event, and/or banned from future tech@nyu activities, at the sole discretion
        of the Tech@NYU leadership and the event
        organizers. <br><br>
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff
        immediately. Additionally, you can contact David Wang, Tech@NYU’s
        President, at dhw249@stern.nyu.edu and [phone number]. To the largest
        extent possible, reports of harassment will be kept confidential;
        usually, this means they will only be shared Tech@NYU board members
        who are not involved in the incident and are directly dealing with
        anti-harassment enforcement, or with law enforcement/venue security
        should their presence become necessary. <br><br>
        Tech@NYU leadership and/or event staff will be happy to help participants
        contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts,
        or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the
        duration of the event. <br><br>
        We value your participation and hope that by widely communicating
        these expectations we can all enjoy a welcoming environment. <br><br>

        This anti-harassment policy is based on Code for America’s Anti-Harassment
        policy and the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki,
        created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers. Those policies were in
        turn based on several others, including the Ohio LinuxFest anti-harassment
        policy, written by Esther Filderman and Beth Lynn Eicher, and the
        Con Anti-Harassment Project. Mary Gardiner, Valerie Aurora, Sarah
        Smith, and Donna Benjamin generalized the policies and added supporting
        material. Many members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other
        groups contributed to this work. The policy shown above was edited into
        its present form by Ethan Resnick.
