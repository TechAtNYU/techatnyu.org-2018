<p>Tech@NYU explores and solves problems, big and small, using technology.

We do this through:

Connecting students to the larger technology community
Educating and sharing resources only possible to obtain as a group
Connecting students across different disciplines
We recognize the power of technology. We are hackers in the purest sense.

Started in 2009, Tech@NYU is one of the most diverse, most forward-moving student organizations, empowering thousands of students across NYC.</p>

History

Tech@NYU was created in Fall 2009 to connect technical and non-technical NYU students interested in building technology startups. Incubated with the help of the NYU Stern Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Tech@NYU held its first event in October 2009 to help students form teams for the Stern Business Plan Competition.

Now, our events are routinely attended by thousands from the NYU undergrad and graduate community as well as from other universities residing in New York City. We are an officially-recognized NYU All-Square club.
